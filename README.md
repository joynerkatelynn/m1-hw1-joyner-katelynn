## About Me ##
My name is Katelynn Joyner, and I am a graduate student at the University of Florida on the political communications track. I live in Gainesville, Florida, and enjoy spending time with my friends and family by playing board games.
## Past Coding Experience ##
I have very limited coding experience. In fact, the last time I tried to code, I was in 7th grade! However, I think this is a useful skill that I am excited to learn.
## Career Goals ##
1. Receive my first full-time job offer in the field of public relations or politics in Florida.
2. Move to Washington, D.C., and work with a federal agency or non-profit. 
3. Work in the White House as White House Press Secretary.
